   /* The stricter cross-primitive coherency guarantees that the hardware
    * gives us with the "Accesses UAV" bit set for at least one shader stage
    * and the "UAV coherency required" bit set on the 3DPRIMITIVE command are
    * redundant within the current image, atomic counter and SSBO GL APIs,
    * which all have very loose ordering and coherency requirements and
    * generally rely on the application to insert explicit barriers when a
    * shader invocation is expected to see the memory writes performed by the
    * invocations of some previous primitive.  Regardless of the value of "UAV
    * coherency required", the "Accesses UAV" bits will implicitly cause an in
    * most cases useless DC flush when the lowermost stage with the bit set
    * finishes execution.
    *
    * It would be nice to disable it, but in some cases we can't because on
    * Gen8+ it also has an influence on rasterization via the PS UAV-only
    * signal (which could be set independently from the coherency mechanism in
    * the 3DSTATE_WM command on Gen7), and because in some cases it will
    * determine whether the hardware skips execution of the fragment shader or
    * not via the ThreadDispatchEnable signal.  However if we know that
    * GEN8_PS_BLEND_HAS_WRITEABLE_RT is going to be set and
    * GEN8_PSX_PIXEL_SHADER_NO_RT_WRITE is not set it shouldn't make any
    * difference so we may just disable it here.
    *
    * Gen8 hardware tries to compute ThreadDispatchEnable for us but doesn't
    * take into account KillPixels when no depth or stencil writes are enabled.
    * In order for occlusion queries to work correctly with no attachments, we
    * need to force-enable here.
